# Vigenère Cipher

A Python implementation of the Vigenère Cipher for encoding and decoding text.

## Description

The Vigenère Cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. It uses a keyword to determine the shift for each letter in the plaintext. This project implements the cipher and allows both encryption and decryption of messages.

## Features
- **Encryption**: Uses a keyword to shift each letter in the plaintext by varying amounts based on the keyword's letters.
- **Decryption**: Reverses the encryption process to return the original message using the same keyword.
- Handles both **uppercase** and **lowercase** letters, while ignoring non-alphabetical characters.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Vigenere-Cipher.git
